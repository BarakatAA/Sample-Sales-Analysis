# Data Sourcing and Cleaning
The kevin cookie dataset was sourced online and comprises of two seperate datasets for the years 2019 and 2020. There were 526 rows in the first dataset and 175 in the second. I combined both datasets into one using the append feature of the power query editor in Microsoft Excel.

# Conclusion and Recommendation
Kevin Cookie company's 2020 production and revenue increase  is a good step which should be maintained and even surpassed in the coming years. Low performing products like Fortune Cookies will benefit from a Customer preference analysis to determine if the product should still remain in production and what new cookie flavours can be introduced and efforts should be made to expand into other countries.

Kevin Cookie company seems to be in good stead and it would be interesting to see what market exploits and new grounds the company is able to break into in the coming years.
